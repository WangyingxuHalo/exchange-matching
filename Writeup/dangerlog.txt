1.	We think about the cases that clients offer xml with no attributes when it requires attributes. But we do not implement this as we assume what clients offer will be correct.

2.	We think about the cases when clients give incorrect length in the head of xml. However, we assume clients will give correct length in this project.

3.	We think about the case when a client wants to sell the position that he/she doesnâ€™t have. In this case, it will return error message.

4.	We assume the input xml is legal in grammar. However, illegal grammar may cause program to crash. We do not handle this part.

5.	We do not have security protection in handling incoming requests. For example, user A can cancel or query the order that user B requests.

6.	In server part, we use multi-processing instead of multi-threading. It is because we use Python. And in Python multi-threading will not actually use multiple cores. Multi-threading enables us to fully utilize multi cores.

7.  If users cancel a tranasaction id and this transaction has no open tranaction to cancel(1. no transaction 2. all executable), then server will response with an error tag, saying: no open order to cancel

8. In general,  we limit the process number to a reasonable number so the machine won't have out of memory issue.
